      "PMT Pro - User FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) GENERAL USAGE Q1: What is PMT Pro? A1: PMT Pro is an AI-powered project management tool designed to help teams plan, collaborate, and execute projects more efficiently. It integrates traditional project management features like Kanban boards, task lists, timelines, and team chat with advanced AI capabilities including smart task prioritization, predictive analytics, and an expert chatbot assistant, along with on-tip-availability of everything about the project using Agentic RAG technology for keeping all informed with relevant information, for the ask. Q2: How is PMT Pro different from Basecamp, Trello, or Asana? A2: Unlike those platforms, PMT Pro includes: A 24/7 AI assistant powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model Automatic task prioritization and deadline tracking Dynamic filtering by project context Meeting summaries, intelligent suggestions, and risk alerts A built-in document and link repository for each project Q3: What kind of users is PMT Pro designed for? A3: PMT Pro is ideal for agile software teams, consultancies, distributed teams, and organizations managing multiple concurrent projects. It's built to be simple enough for daily users and powerful enough for technical and project leads. KANBAN BOARD & TASK MANAGEMENT Q4: How do I use the Kanban board? A4: The Kanban board displays tasks in four stages: To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done. You can drag and drop cards between stages, assign due dates, and add team members. Each card can also include notes and priority tags. Q5: What does the color-coded priority mean? A5: Red: High priority Orange: Medium priority Green: Low priority These labels help you identify the urgency of each task. Q6: What is the difference between 'Tasks' and 'Kanban cards'? A6: Tasks from the 'Tasks' page are general-purpose and can be assigned independently. Kanban cards represent workflow-based tasks tied to a process.\n",
      "---\n",
      "insights, prioritize your actions, advise on tasks”). This tight integration of chatbot guidance within the project workspace exemplifies PMT Pro’s unique AI-driven user experience. Key Product Capabilities and AI Differentiators PMT Pro delivers all the essential capabilities expected of a modern project management platform, with the added advantage of AI-driven intelligence and automation. Below is an overview of its core features and what sets them apart: Comprehensive Project Management Suite: Includes task management (with due dates, assignees, statuses), Kanban boards for agile workflows, calendar/timeline views (Day/Week/Month) for scheduling, and integrated team chat. These fundamentals are on par with leading tools – the MVP already covers most essential functions found in Basecamp/Asanafile-lzwt1a8jfgwduo7egwmbrr. Notably, PMT Pro supports agile methodologies (e.g. Scrum boards from To Do → Done) and time-based planning out-of-the-box, whereas Basecamp favors simplicity over structured planning. AI-Powered Task Prioritization: The system automatically ranks and highlights tasks based on urgency, deadlines, and even dependencies. This intelligent sorting means project managers and team members always see the most critical work first – a capability absent in Basecamp, Trello, or Asana (none of which offer built-in AI-driven prioritizationfile-lzwt1a8jfgwduo7egwmbrr). By analyzing project data and user behavior, PMT Pro’s AI can recommend what each user should focus on next, something competitors require manual effort or external tools to achieve. RAG-based Expert Assistant: PMT Pro’s integrated chatbot utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an AI approach that combines live information retrieval with generative AIcloud.google.com. In practice, this means the chatbot can pull in relevant context from project documents, past conversations, task history, and knowledge bases in real time, and use that context to generate accurate, tailored responses. Users can ask the assistant questions like “What were last week’s key decisions?” or “Are there any blockers for the Q2 release?”, and get instant answers grounded in the project’s actual\n",
      "---\n",
      "High priority Orange: Medium priority Green: Low priority These labels help you identify the urgency of each task. Q6: What is the difference between 'Tasks' and 'Kanban cards'? A6: Tasks from the 'Tasks' page are general-purpose and can be assigned independently. Kanban cards represent workflow-based tasks tied to a process. PMT Pro allows both, and distinguishes them automatically in the To-Do List. TO-DO LIST & TIMELINE Q7: How is the To-Do list organized? A7: The To-Do list is automatically sorted by due date, with overdue tasks highlighted at the top. It combines tasks from both Kanban and general Task entries. Q8: Can I see my tasks on a calendar or timeline? A8: Yes. You can view all tasks on a Day/Week/Month timeline and filter by project or team member. TEAM CHAT & COLLABORATION Q9: How does team chat work in PMT Pro? A9: The Team Chat module allows real-time collaboration between members. Each message is saved and indexed. Mentions (e.g., @john) notify specific users. The chat is tied to your project context. Q10: Can chats be converted into tasks? A10: Yes. The chatbot can parse chat content and turn them into tasks with due dates and assignments using natural language commands. AI ASSISTANT (CHATBOT) Q11: What does the chatbot do? A11: The AI assistant can: Summarize recent project activity Prioritize your To-Do list Answer project-specific questions Suggest next steps or highlight risks Turn notes or chat into tasks Q12: What is RAG and why is it important? A12: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It enables the chatbot to search project documents, chat logs, task lists, and more before generating a response—ensuring it gives you accurate, up-to-date, and project-specific guidance. Q13: What kind of data can the chatbot use? A13: The bot uses: Chat messages Kanban task metadata Timeline and To-Do\n"
